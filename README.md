# Pacord

## Install
```sh
> # Install playerctl
> # Go to discord developer portal, create application, copy client id
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> export CLIENT_ID="ur client id"
> ./launch
```

## BTW
- I used Discord installed directly from discord`s site.
- IDK what`s about flatpaked Discord, etc...
